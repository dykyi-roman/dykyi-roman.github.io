            <h2>üîî Introduction</h2>
            <p>Code structure is not just about organizing files and folders in a project; it is a fundamental aspect of
                development that impacts its efficiency, quality, and long-term maintainability. A well-organized
                codebase enhances understanding, simplifies the implementation of new features, and reduces the
                likelihood of errors. Regardless of the project‚Äôs scale ‚Äî whether a small application or a complex
                system ‚Äî a structured approach to code organization helps mitigate risks associated with technical debt.
                It boosts the productivity of the development team. However, not all developers fully grasp the
                significant difference between projects with a thoughtfully designed structure and those with chaotic
                organization.</p>
            <p>This article will explore what ‚Äúclear code structure‚Äù means and why it is crucial for successful
                development.</p>

            <h3>Criteria of clarity</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each file and folder has a clear purpose.</li>
                <li>The organization of the project‚Äôs file system should be intuitive and easy to understand.</li>
                <li>Logic is divided into modules, layers, or functional areas.</li>
                <li>Separating logic simplifies understanding of the system and reduces the coupling between
                    components.
                </li>
                <li>File, variable, and function names reflect their roles.</li>
                <li>Names should be self-documenting, meaning they should convey their purpose without requiring a deep
                    dive into the implementation details.
                </li>
                <li>Coding standards adopted by the team are followed.</li>
                <li>Adhering to a consistent coding style makes the code easier to read and understand.</li>
                <li>Adding new features does not disrupt the existing structure.</li>
                <li>The project should be designed in a way that allows new functionality to be added with minimal
                    changes to the existing code.
                </li>
                <li>The architecture anticipates future growth.</li>
                <li>The project should be built with scalability and future changes in mind.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üîñ Monolithic</h2>
            <img src="img/5.1.png" alt="" class="article-featured-img">

            <h3>What are the problems we have?</h3>
            <h4>Too General Level of Abstraction</h4>
            <p>The structure is built around categories that reflect technical aspects of the code (e.g., Service,
                Repository, Validator). This approach neglects the application's domain, making the system harder to
                understand, especially for new developers who may not know which modules relate to which
                functionality.</p>

            <h4>Lack of Modularity</h4>
            <p>This results in changes to one part of the code often requiring modifications in files across multiple
                directories, increasing the likelihood of errors. When adding new functionality, in 95% of cases, you‚Äôll
                need to distribute code across several directories. This increases cognitive load as the logic of a
                single module is scattered throughout the project. It also leads to more merge conflicts, as multiple
                developers may modify the same code.</p>

            <h4>Navigation Complexity</h4>
            <p>Directories become ‚Äújunk drawers‚Äù where files from different functionalities accumulate, making them hard
                to locate and categorize.</p>

            <h4>Violation of DDD</h4>
            <p>Modern approaches to designing complex systems recommend structuring projects around domain entities and
                the application‚Äôs domain. The proposed structure lacks a clear separation between business logic and
                infrastructural concerns.</p>

            <h4>Scalability Issues</h4>
            <p>As the codebase grows, the proposed structure begins to ‚Äúbloat.‚Äù Directories become overloaded with
                files, and file names start to duplicate. Additionally, file sizes grow, leading to other code
                smells.</p>

            <h4>Violations of SOLID Principles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>S (Single Responsibility Principle):</strong> Directories like Service, Helper, and
                    Constants violate SRP because they group files for technical purposes rather than functionality.
                    This results in files within a single directory addressing completely different aspects of the
                    system.
                </li>
                <li><strong>O (Open/Closed Principle):</strong> The structure makes it difficult to extend functionality
                    without modifying existing code. For instance, adding new business logic often requires changes to
                    existing services or validators, violating the open/closed principle.
                </li>
                <li><strong>L (Liskov Substitution Principle):</strong> No violations were identified.</li>
                <li><strong>I (Interface Segregation Principle):</strong> General-purpose directories like Helper or
                    Validator encourage utility classes with overly broad interfaces, forcing users to interact with
                    methods they don‚Äôt need.
                </li>
                <li><strong>D (Dependency Inversion Principle):</strong> Dependencies in the current structure are often
                    defined at the infrastructure level (e.g., Repository, ElasticSearch) rather than at the abstraction
                    level. This violates DIP, as modules depend on implementation details rather than abstractions.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Violations of GRASP Principles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Expert:</strong> Classes and modules are not organized around business logic.
                    Responsibilities are scattered across the structure, requiring developers to search the entire
                    project to understand where data is processed.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Low Coupling & High Cohesion:</strong> The code of a single module is split across multiple
                    directories, reducing cohesion. Instead of grouping related classes, they are scattered throughout
                    the project. This structure also encourages excessive coupling between modules.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Violations of the KISS Principle</h4>
            <p>The structure complicates understanding of the system, as new developers must memorize where to find
                specific logic. Simplicity is undermined by the scattered codebase.</p>

            <h2>üîñ MVC</h2>
            <img src="img/5.2.png" alt="" class="article-featured-img">

            <h3>What are the problems we have?</h3>
            <p>Occurs in small projects. Has similar problems with unstructured ways of organizing.</p>

            <h2>üîñ Multilayer</h2>
            <img src="img/5.3.png" alt="" class="article-featured-img">

            <h3>Advantages of the Structure</h3>
            <p>This structure provides a clear separation of responsibilities. Changes in one layer will not affect
                others (e.g., replacing the database). New layers or modules can be added without significant
                modifications to the rest. Each layer has a strictly defined role:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Handles user requests.</li>
                <li><strong>Application:</strong> Coordinates actions and invokes business logic.</li>
                <li><strong>Domain:</strong> The core containing business logic.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Handles technical details.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This organization is significantly better but still not perfect, as it also has its drawbacks.</p>

            <h3>What are the problems we have?</h3>
            <h4>Layers Communicate Through Interfaces</h4>
            <p>This increases the number of DTOs required for data transfer between layers. Logic related to a single
                domain can still be scattered across layers.</p>

            <h4>Violations of SOLID Principles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>S (Single Responsibility Principle):</strong> Code related to a single functionality is
                    scattered across layers, making the system harder to understand. For example, a Order module is
                    forced to include separate components in each layer instead of being localized.
                </li>
                <li><strong>O (Open/Closed Principle):</strong> No violations were detected.</li>
                <li><strong>L (Liskov Substitution Principle):</strong> No violations were detected.</li>
                <li><strong>I (Interface Segregation Principle):</strong> No violations were detected.</li>
                <li><strong>D (Dependency Inversion Principle):</strong> Poor code organization can violate this
                    principle when interfaces are defined alongside implementations in the Infrastructure layer rather
                    than in the Domain layer.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Violations of GRASP Principles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low Coupling & High Cohesion:</strong> Code related to a single functionality is still
                    scattered across multiple directories (layers). Poor organization can also violate this principle
                    when, for instance, the Application layer depends directly on the Domain, and the Domain depends on
                    the Infrastructure. To prevent this, interfaces should be used for communication between layers to
                    avoid direct dependencies.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Code Duplication</h4>
            <p>Code duplication is not necessarily an issue, and here‚Äôs why:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Duplication can sometimes be a justified decision, especially when:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The code looks similar but serves different business domains.</li>
                    <li>Changes in one place should not affect another.</li>
                    <li>Contexts of use differ significantly.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>Logic Duplication</h4>
            <p>Logic duplication is truly dangerous! It‚Äôs important not to confuse these two concepts ‚Äî accidental code
                similarity and actual duplication of business logic.</p>

            <h2>üîñ Clean Architecture</h2>
            <img src="img/5.4.png" alt="" class="article-featured-img">

            <blockquote>Use Cases are application components that handle business logic, interact with entities, and
                perform specific operations within the application.
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Advantages of the Structure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clear Domain Organization:</strong> Each application layer separates business logic from
                    technical details, keeping the code organized and understandable. This makes the project‚Äôs structure
                    easier to grasp and maintain.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Convenient Project Navigation:</strong> Logical and consistent categorization of files
                    (e.g., Entities, UseCases, Presenters) ensures intuitive project navigation. Developers can quickly
                    locate necessary components without wasting time searching.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scalability When Adding New Features:</strong> Each layer in this architecture is isolated,
                    simplifying the process of adding new features or modifying existing ones. Adding a new use case or
                    business rule won‚Äôt complicate the work of other layers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Component Isolation:</strong> Separating logic into layers reduces interdependencies between
                    components. Changes in one layer (e.g., the database or external interface) don‚Äôt impact other
                    layers, enhancing the system‚Äôs modularity and testability.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What are the problems we have?</h3>
            <h4>Complexity in Understanding and Maintenance</h4>
            <p>Dividing the application into multiple layers and components can make the system harder to understand and
                maintain. Adding ports and adapters increases the number of interfaces and abstractions, which might
                make the project more complex, particularly for new developers.</p>

            <h4>Violations of SOLID Principles</h4>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Each module‚Äôs logic is isolated, helping minimize the impact of

                    remain isolated from other modules.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Adding new functionality or modules (e.g., a Partner module) does not

                <li><strong>Ease of Testing:</strong> Each module can be tested in isolation, simplifying the creation

            <h2>‚ú® Advices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tip #1:</strong> Sometimes layers can be excessive. For example, if we have a small domain
                    and can confidently say that it will not expand.
                    <img src="img/5.7.png" alt="" class="article-featured-img">
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tip #2:</strong> Sometimes layers can include multiple subdomains. In this case, the
                    structure will be expanded.

                <li>
                    <strong>Tip #3:</strong> Moving configuration, migrations, and fixtures within the module boundaries
                    makes the module fully self-contained: everything needed for development, testing, and deployment is

            <p>It isolates configurations, migrations, and fixtures into a separate folder, simplifying navigation and
                distinguishing resources related to setup or infrastructure aspects from business logic. All tests
                related to the module are stored in its Tests folder, improving isolation. This approach makes it easier
                to test and extract the module into a microservice if needed.</p>
