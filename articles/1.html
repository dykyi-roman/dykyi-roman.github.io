            <h2>🔔 Introduction</h2>
            <p>👩‍💻 Programming is a journey filled with challenges and opportunities for growth. I started my journey in
                2010 in the small city of Zolotonosha and have continued to grow in my profession ever since. I remember
                the nights spent writing code, living off nothing but microwave pizza. The experience I’ve gained allows
                me to confidently discuss the steps and approaches that I will outline in this article.</p>
            <p>Throughout my development career, I have worked with various programming languages, such as Delphi,
                JavaScript, PHP, and Go, and with different domains including Cassino, CMS, Billing, Gambling, and
                Marketplace.</p>
            <p>In this article, I want to share my experience, which may be useful for beginners who want to enter IT
                but don’t know where to start. I hope my advice will help you adapt more quickly to the world of
                programming and avoid some of the mistakes I encountered along my journey.</p>

            <h2>📚 Education</h2>
            <p>Having an education in IT does not guarantee that you will become a programmer. I know what I say, I do
                it based on the experience of my university group — only 20% of graduates went on to work in IT.
                Therefore, if you decide to enroll in an IT specialty, it will certainly make your path easier; you will
                have five years to go through 5 stages of life acceptance ;)</p>
            <p>If you don’t have an IT education, that’s fine — we have IT courses for you. They promise that you will
                become a programmer in 3–6 months. However, having worked as a teacher at one of the IT schools, I can
                confidently say that the percentage of people who become programmers after courses is even lower — only
                about 5% (based on personal calculations).</p>
            <p>Why does this happen? The time for learning is limited, there’s little time for homework, you have
                already a primary job, and most students simply don’t manage to go through all 5 stages of acceptance.
                50% remain in the denial stage, realizing that programming is not for them; 20% get stuck in anger; only
                10% reach the bargaining stage; another 10% are in depression, and only 10% make it to the acceptance
                stage.</p>

            <h2>✨ Types of development</h2>
            <p>The choice of development direction often depends on your interests and goals, whether it’s creating web

            <h1>👨 Middle/Middle+: Development</h1>
            <p>After 2–3 years, you’ve gained your first experience in programming as a Junior developer. However, to
                move up to the next level and become a Middle developer, it’s essential not only to strengthen your
                knowledge but also to develop skills that will make you a valuable team member.</p>

            <blockquote>Let’s discuss the Middle+ position first.</blockquote>

            <p>There is no such gradation. Unfortunately, in today’s reality, some companies prefer to under-evaluate
                experienced specialists by classifying them as Middle+ instead of hiring Senior developers. This leads
                to a distorted understanding of career growth and can diminish the motivation of professionals.
                Therefore, if you truly feel the strength within yourself to advance to the next level and become a
                Senior, you need to deepen your technical skills sufficiently.</p>
            <p>Currently, there are far more courses for Junior developers than for Middle developers. Your goal should
                focus on gaining practical experience. A wealth of information and resources is available in the form of
                books, articles, and video tutorials, which can help deepen your knowledge in specific areas.
                Additionally, some companies offer individual or specialized training for teams. Here’s a list of how
                you can independently develop your skills:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn a new programming language and understand its nuances.</li>
                <li>Master a new framework and integrate it into your projects.</li>
                <li>Continuously learn new technologies and approaches in development.</li>
                <li>Write tests (Unit, Functional, Integration) and learn to test your code at various levels.</li>
                <li>Continue to develop your GitHub account by adding new projects and improving existing ones.</li>
                <li>Participate in open-source projects for real-world coding experience and community engagement.</li>
                <li>Enhance your communication skills at work by engaging in discussions and providing feedback.</li>
                <li>Try mentoring Junior developers to share your experience.</li>
                <li>Obtain additional certifications to validate your skills.</li>
                <li>Attend conferences and meetups to network and gain fresh insights.</li>
                <li>Study architectural principles and design patterns, applying them in your projects.</li>
                <li>Work on your soft skills (time management, emotional intelligence, teamwork).</li>
                <li>Gradually learn DevOps practices such as automation, CI/CD, and containerization.</li>
                <li>Experiment with being a speaker at conferences by delivering talks.</li>
                <li>Read technical literature, and blogs, and participate in online courses to broaden your knowledge.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>By following these steps and continuously developing your skills, you can successfully transition to the
                level of a Middle developer.</p>

            <hr>
            <h1>👴 Senior: Expertise</h1>
            <p>It has been 5+ years since we entered the IT field. However, the transition from a Middle developer to a
                Senior developer can be more challenging than moving from Junior to Middle. The primary reason is that
                at the Senior level, specialists are expected to possess not only deep technological knowledge but also
                a wide range of other skills and qualities.</p>
            <p>Thus, the shift from a Middle to a Senior position is not just a step up the career ladder; it represents
                significant growth in both professional and personal skills. This journey requires time, patience, and
                continuous self-development, making it a true challenge for many developers.</p>
            <p>Another crucial aspect is how Senior roles are perceived within the company. If colleagues and management
                are accustomed to seeing you as a Middle developer, a stereotype may arise that complicates your
                transition. In such cases, changing jobs might be beneficial, as it can be easier to start with a clean
                slate and establish yourself as a Senior developer in a new company.</p>
            <p>It’s also worth noting that in some organizations, career advancement at the Senior level may be limited.
                A lack of vacancies, high competition, and uncertainty regarding expectations for Senior developers can
                add to the difficulties in this process.</p>
            <h3>Who is a Senior developer?</h3>
            <p>They are undoubtedly someone who embodies the following traits:</p>
            <ul>

                        <li>Continuous self-learning and a commitment to professional development.</li>
                        <li>Adaptability to change and flexible thinking.</li>
                        <li>Critical thinking and analytical approach.</li>

                        <li>Mastery of best coding practices (SOLID, DRY, KISS, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of essential application security principles (OWASP, encryption,
                            authentication).
                        </li>
                        <li>Ability to analyze and optimize application performance.</li>
                        <li>Contribution to open-source and participation in professional communities.</li>
                        <li>Understanding of DevOps practices (CI/CD, containerization, orchestration).</li>

                level of a Senior developer.</p>

            <hr>
            <h1>👀 Developer level gradation</h1>
            <p>Finally, want to leave some words about level gradation. The distinctions between Junior, Middle, and
                Senior levels in software development generally reflect the developer’s experience, skill set, and the
                responsibilities expected in their roles. Here’s the translation: It’s important to remember that the
                level of specialization is very subjective and depends on the scale and culture of the company you work
                for. For example, if you hold a Senior position at Company X, it doesn’t mean that you will be perceived
                the same way at Company Y, where different standards and requirements may apply. This is normal, and
                it’s essential to understand that each organization has its own criteria for assessing skills and
                experience.</p>

            <hr>
            <h1>🏁 Conclusion</h1>
            <p>On the path to mastery as a developer, it’s important to remember that success is not just a collection
                of technical skills but also a constant drive for growth, the ability to work in a team and adapt to
                changes. Strive for learning, try new approaches, and don’t be afraid to step outside your comfort
                zone.</p>
            <p>Remember that mastery is a process, not an endpoint. Every new project, each mistake, and every victory
                is a step toward your perfection. Believe in yourself, and your journey to mastery will lead you to
                success!</p>
