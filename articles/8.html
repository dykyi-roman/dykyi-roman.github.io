            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Validation and Error Handling are fundamental challenges every developer faces, whether working with HTTP
                requests, task queues, event processing, or asynchronous communication between system components.</p>

            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>Your chosen strategy directly impacts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Synchronous requests can block code execution, while asynchronous
                    approaches reduce server load.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Task queues and message brokers enable distributed workloads across
                    services.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Flawed input validation or ignored CSRF tokens can introduce
                    vulnerabilities.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Remember: Frontend validation can never replace backend validation!</em></p>

            <p>When the backend receives data from the frontend/third-party API or script, the "Never Trust User Input"
                principle is the foundation of security. Backend data validation is a multi-layered process where each
                stage serves its purpose:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Framework</strong> — The first filter checks request structure, including data types,
                    required fields, and basic formats (e.g., email validity via regex).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Domain Layer (DDD)</strong> — Here, data is validated against business logic. For example,
                    you can't create an order with a past date, even if it's technically correct. Such rules are
                    encapsulated within Entities or Aggregates to maintain domain integrity.
                </li>
                <li><strong>ORM</strong> — Libraries like Doctrine or ActiveRecord ORM provide validation at the object
                    model level. They check data formats, type compliance, and business rules before executing database
                    queries. For example, validating an email format or checking value ranges. ORM also protects against
                    SQL injections through prepared statements and input data escaping.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Database</strong> — The last line of defense for data protection. Here, built-in database
                    constraints come into play: CHECK, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY, as well as triggers and stored procedures.
                    These mechanisms ensure data integrity regardless of the application code. For example, a CHECK
                    (price > 0) at the database level guarantees that a product with a negative price will not be saved,
                    even if all previous validation layers missed the error.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Security</strong> — Specialized checks: HTML tag sanitization (against XSS), CSRF token
                    validation, access authorization. These mechanisms are often built into middleware or API gateway
                    filters.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Example workflow: A user submits birthdate 2077–01–01.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Framework validates the date format (correct).</li>
                <li>Domain layer rejects it as a future date.</li>
                <li>If missed, the database triggers a `BEFORE INSERT` check comparing the date with the current time.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote><strong>Key point:</strong> Each layer duplicates previous checks, creating "defense layers" that
                mitigate risks even if one layer becomes compromised.</blockquote>

            <hr>
            <h1>Framework</h1>
            <strong>First Validation Level: Framework-Level Protection</strong>

            <p>Imagine your application is a fortress. The first line of defense is the gate that keeps out enemies and
                debris. Framework-level validation acts as precisely that gate. It prevents invalid data from breaking
                through to your business logic, keeping your code clean and your users protected.</p>

            <p>Let's examine how this works in Symfony and Laravel — and why you shouldn't rely only on this layer.</p>

            <blockquote>Validation in frameworks follows different architectural patterns, but the goal remains the same: <strong>isolate raw data from business logic</strong>.</blockquote>

            <h3>Symfony</h3>
            <h4>Symfony: <a target="_blank" href="https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-6-3-mapping-request-data-to-typed-objects">Clean DTO Approach</a></h4>

            <p>Symfony enforces <strong>strict separation</strong> using <strong>Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)</strong> with built-in validation:</p>

            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Define a DTO class with validation rules (via annotations, YAML, or XML).</li>
                <li>The framework automatically validates incoming data before it reaches the controller.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Key advantages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keeps application layers clean (no infrastructure code in controllers).</li>
                <li>Reusable validation rules (e.g., @Assert\Email, @Assert\Range(min: 1, max: 100)).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Validator Component Features:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supports annotations (e.g., @Assert\NotBlank), YAML, or XML for rule definitions.</li>
                <li>Built-in validators for data types, formats (email, URL), and numeric ranges.</li>
                <li>Custom constraints via Constraint and ConstraintValidator interfaces.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>
use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints as Assert;

final readonly class CreateUserRequest {
    #[Assert\NotBlank]
    #[Assert\Email]
    public string $email;
    
    #[Assert\NotBlank]
    #[Assert\Length(min: 6)]
    public string $password;
}</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Laravel</h3>
            <h4>Laravel: Form Requests & Fluid Validation</h4>
            <p>Laravel takes a pragmatic approach with Form Requests and inline validation.</p>

            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Generate dedicated request classes (e.g., php artisan make:request StoreUserRequest).</li>
                <li>Define rules like 'email' => 'required|email|unique:users'.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Key advantages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Declarative syntax (rules as arrays or pipe-separated strings).</li>
                <li>Automatic redirection or JSON error responses.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Flexible validation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use facades (Validator::make()) for quick checks.</li>
                <li>Custom rules via Rule::class or closure-based rules.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>public function rules() {
    return [
        'email' => 'required|email|unique:users',
        'password' => 'required|min:6',
    ];
}</pre>
            </div>

            <h4>Laravel and DTOs: Manual Transformation for Clean Architecture</h4>
            <p>Unlike Symfony, Laravel does not natively support DTOs, but developers use workarounds to prevent raw
                Request objects from leaking into business logic. Here's how it's typically done:</p>

            <p><strong>1. Manual Conversion to DTO.</strong> Transform $request->all() into a dedicated
                UserData/OrderData object before passing it to services.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>final class UserStoreAction {
    public function __invoke(CreateUserRequest $request): void {
        $userData = new UserData(
            email: $request->validated('email'),
            password: $request->validated('password')
        );
        UserService::create($userData); // Clean domain service call
    }
}</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>2. Data Mapper Pattern.</strong> Use libraries like Spatie's Data Transfer Object or Laravel Data
                to auto-map requests to typed objects.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>use Spatie\DataTransferObject\DataTransferObject;

final readonly class UserData extends DataTransferObject {
    public string $email;
    public string $password;
}
// In action:
$userData = new UserData(...$request->validated());</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>3. Manual Casting.</strong> Use an abstract request for magic property casting</p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>/**
 * Abstract request class that provides property access with automatic type casting.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * ```php
 * /**
 *  * @property-read int $userId
 *  * @property-read string $email
 *  *\/
 * final class MyRequest extends AbstractRequest
 * {
 *     private const string FIELD_USER_ID = 'userId';
 *     private const string FIELD_EMAIL   = 'email';
 *
 *     protected const array PROPERTY_TYPE_MAP = [
 *         self::FIELD_USER_ID => 'int',
 *         self::FIELD_EMAIL   => 'string',
 *     ];
 * }
 *
 * is_int($request->userId)   // true
 * is_string($request->email) // true
 *
 * ```
 */
abstract class AbstractRequest extends FormRequest
{
    protected const PROPERTY_TYPE_MAP = [];

    public function __get(mixed $key)
    {
        $value = $this->input($key);
        if (isset(static::PROPERTY_TYPE_MAP[$key])) {
            return $this->castValue($value, $key, static::PROPERTY_TYPE_MAP[$key]);
        }
        return $value;
    }
    
    protected function castValue(mixed $value, string $key, string $type): mixed
    {
        $isNullable = str_starts_with($type, '?');
        if ($isNullable) {
            if ($value === null) {
                return null;
            }
            $type = substr($type, 1);
        }
        
        if (class_exists($type) && is_a($type, BackedEnum::class, true)) {
            return $type::from($value);
        }
        
        return match ($type) {
            'int' => (int) $value,
            'float' => (float) $value,
            'bool' => (bool) $value,
            'string' => (string) $value,
            'array' => (array) $value,
            'datetime_immutable' => $this->castToDateTimeImmutable($value),
            default => $value,
        };
    }
    
    protected function castToDateTimeImmutable(mixed $value): ?DateTimeImmutable
    {
        try {
            return new DateTimeImmutable($value);
        } catch (Throwable) {
            return null;
        }
    }
}</pre>
            </div>

            <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Prevents accidental reliance on request structure (e.g.,
                    $request->input('x.y')).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Type Safety:</strong> Enforces property types (e.g., string $email).</li>
                <li><strong>Testability:</strong> DTOs are easier to mock than Request objects.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Framework-Level Validation Matters</h3>
            <p>Framework validation isn't just technical formalism — it delivers tangible benefits for security,
                development speed, and system reliability. Here's what it achieves in practice:</p>

            <h4>Key Advantages</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Standardized Early Errors.</strong> Returns predictable HTTP statuses (e.g., 422
                    Unprocessable Entity instead of 500 Server Error). Structured error messages simplify frontend
                    integration.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tooling Integration.</strong> Validation rules auto-populate Swagger/OpenAPI docs, helping
                    frontend and QA teams understand API requirements.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Eliminates Boilerplate.</strong> No manual checks like if (!$request->has('email'))—the
                    framework handles it.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Protects Domain Logic.</strong> Business logic stays clean of low-level checks (e.g., "Is
                    this a valid email format?"). Focuses on domain rules (e.g., "Can this user reserve a VIP seat?").
                </li>
                <li><strong>Built-in Security.</strong> Validators often sanitize data (e.g., Laravel's the the email
                    rule removes dangerous characters).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Best Practices</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Use native validators for common cases:
                    <ul>
                        <li>uuid, date_format, mimes:jpg,png (Laravel).</li>
                        <li>@Assert\Uuid, @Assert\DateTime (Symfony).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Avoid Duplication:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Laravel: Form Request classes.</li>
                        <li>Symfony: Validation groups or custom constraint classes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Custom Rules for Complex Cases</li>
            </ol>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Framework validation <strong>only checks syntax</strong> (format, structure). It <strong>cannot enforce business rules</strong> like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Does this user have permission to cancel this order?"</li>
                <li>"Is this discount code valid for the selected products?"</li>
            </ul>
            </blockquote>

            <hr>
            <h1>Domain Layer</h1>
            <p>After framework-level validation, domain validation becomes the critical next stage — a mechanism that
                ensures compliance with all business rules and invariants within your core logic. Here, we're not just
                checking if data is formally correct (e.g., valid email format), but whether it aligns with your
                specific business requirements. It answers questions like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Can this user perform the action?</li>
                <li>Does the operation violate any business constraints?</li>
                <li>Is the data meaningful within our domain logic?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Domain validation ensures that objects are always in a correct state. For example, an "Order" object
                cannot be created if the order amount is below the minimum threshold or if required attributes
                describing the business entity are missing. Even if data passes validation at the framework level,
                specialized checks dependent on business logic might be overlooked. It is at the domain level that you
                eliminate the possibility of "incorrect" objects, which could negatively impact the entire system.</p>

            <p>Using Value Objects (VO), aggregates, and invariants allows you to embed business logic validation within
                the domain model, as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>VO</strong> ensures the correctness of individual values through factory methods, immediately preventing the
                    creation of "dirty" data.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Aggregates</strong> establish a context for validating interconnected rules and ensure that operations
                    modifying the state do not violate overall consistency.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Invariants</strong> are used to check complex conditions spanning multiple elements of the domain model,
                    preventing the aggregate from transitioning into an invalid state.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Value Objects (VOs): Guardians of Atomic Validity</h3>
            <p><strong>Encapsulation of Rules:</strong> A VO is created via a constructor or factory method, within
                which all necessary validation is performed. For example, when creating an "Email" object, the address
                format is validated, or when creating a "Money" object, it is ensured that the amount is non-negative.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Always Valid Object:</strong> If the input data does not meet business requirements, the factory
                method will not create the object (returning an error or throwing an exception). This ensures that
                "dirty" values can never exist in the domain model because any attempt to create them will fail. Thus,
                VOs automatically validate a portion of business rules at the level of a single field.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> When creating a VO for "Order Amount," the factory method checks that the
                amount is positive. If an attempt is made to create an "Order Amount" with a negative value, the object
                will not be created, preventing further processing of invalid data.</p>

            <div class="code-block">
<pre>final class OrderAmount {
    private function __construct(private float $value) {}

    public static function create(float $value): Result {
        if ($value <= 0) {
            return Result::failure("Amount must be positive");
        }
        return Result::success(new self($value));
    }
}</pre>
            </div>

            <h4>When to Use VOs</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Atomic Values</strong>: Email, Phone, Money, DateRange, Address.</li>
                <li><strong>Invariants</strong>: Values with strict rules (e.g., "Discount must be 0–100%").</li>
                <li><strong>Domain Primitives</strong>: Values specific to your business (e.g., ProductSKU).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Aggregate as a Context for Validating Interconnected Rules</h3>
            <p><strong>Grouping Interconnected Objects:</strong> An aggregate combines entities and Value Objects (VOs)
                that have business dependencies. For example, an "Order" may consist of multiple items, and the
                aggregate root ensures compliance with rules, such as the correctness of the total order amount or the
                minimum number of items.</p>

            <p><strong>Validation of Business Operations:</strong> All changes within the aggregate are managed through
                its root entity. A method that adds an item to the order first verifies that the addition of the new
                item does not violate the aggregate's invariants (e.g., the maximum number of items or discount
                conditions). If a rule is violated, the operation is not executed.</p>

            <h4>Core Responsibilities of an Aggregate</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Groups Related Objects</li>
                <li>Centralizes Validation</li>
                <li>Protects Invariants</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Implementation Patterns</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Transactional Consistency — changes are all-or-nothing</li>
                <li>Eventual Checks with Domain Events</li>
                <li>External code cannot modify child entities directly</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code-block">
<pre>// ❌ BAD: Bypasses aggregate root
$order->lines[] = new OrderLine(...);

// ✅ GOOD: Root manages changes
$order->addItem($product, 2);</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> The aggregate root method "Add Item to Order" checks that the total order
                amount after adding the item does not exceed the business-defined limit. If the limit is exceeded, the
                method returns an error without modifying the order's state.</p>

            <div class="code-block">
<pre>final class Order {
    private OrderId $id;
    private array $lines = [];
    private Money $total;

    public function addProduct(Product $product, int $quantity): void {
        $this->assertNotPaid(); // Rule: Can't modify paid orders
        $line = new OrderLine($product, $quantity);
        // Rule: Max 10 items per order
        if (count($this->lines) >= 10) {
            throw new DomainException("Order item limit reached");
        }
        $this->lines[] = $line;
        $this->total = $this->total->add($line->subtotal());
    }
}</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Invariant as an Integral Part of the Domain Model</h3>
            <p><strong>Defining Consistency Rules:</strong> Invariants are conditions that must always hold true for an
                aggregate after any operation. They can span multiple objects within the aggregate, such as ensuring
                consistency between an order's start and end dates or requiring that all items belong to the same
                supplier.</p>

            <p><strong>Protection Against Invalid States:</strong> During any business operation, the aggregate root
                ensures that all invariants are satisfied after the changes are applied. This guarantees that the domain
                model never transitions into an invalid state, even if incorrect data is mistakenly passed from higher
                layers.</p>

            <h4>Key Characteristics of Invariants</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Always True</li>
                <li>Cross-Object Rules</li>
                <li>Enforced by the Aggregate Root</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In the "Order" aggregate, an invariant might require that the list of items is
                never empty if the order is already confirmed. If an attempt is made to add an empty item, the aggregate
                throws an error or returns a result indicating the violation, preventing the persistence of an invalid
                order.</p>

            <div class="code-block">
<pre>final class Order {
    private array $items;
    private bool $isConfirmed = false;

    public function confirm(): void {
        // Invariant: Cannot confirm empty orders
        if (empty($this->items)) {
            throw new DomainException("Cannot confirm an empty order");
        }
        $this->isConfirmed = true;
    }
}</pre>
            </div>

            <p>Invariants encode your domain's fundamental truths. By embedding them in aggregates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Illegal states become unrepresentative</li>
                <li>Business rules stay visible in code</li>
                <li>Systems self-protect against logical errors</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Transfer Object as a Mechanism for Data Transfer</h3>
            <p>Data Transfer Object (DTO) is designed to transfer data between layers (e.g., from the interface to the
                application). Its primary purpose is to transmit data structures without embedding complex business
                logic into them</p>

            <p><strong>Basic Validation:</strong> At the DTO level, it's convenient to perform checks for required
                fields, formats (e.g., email, phone number), length constraints, and similar validations. This is often
                done using frameworks or annotations (e.g., Bean Validation or Symfony Validator)</p>
            <p><strong>Where Should Business Validation Occur?</strong> Although DTOs can validate the correctness of
                incoming data, the core business validation (i.e., checking domain invariants and complex,
                context-dependent rules) should be performed within the domain model — specifically in aggregates, their
                entities, or Value Objects (VOs). This ensures that objects operating within the domain are always in a
                correct, "error-free" state.</p>
            <p><strong>Anti-Pattern:</strong></p>

            <div class="code-block">
<pre>// ❌ Business logic in DTO
final readonly class OrderRequest {
    public function isValid(): bool {
        // Checks inventory, user permissions, etc.
    }
}</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>DTOs are dumb containers — no behavior, just data.</li>
                <li>Delegate deep validation to the domain layer (Aggregates/VOs).</li>
                <li>Use framework validators for syntax checks in DTOs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rich Domain Model vs Anemic Domain Model with External Validation</h3>
            <p>In the Rich Domain Model approach, all business logic — including validation rules and invariants — is
                embedded directly within the domain model objects. These objects are responsible for maintaining their
                state correctness. By ensuring objects are only created in a valid state, they guarantee data
                integrity.</p>

            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encapsulation of Rules and Behavior:</strong> All validation and business rules reside
                    within the object itself. For example, when creating an "Order" object via a factory method, the
                    object itself checks that the order amount is positive and that the list of items is not empty. This
                    prevents logic duplication across different services and ensures the object is never in an invalid
                    state.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Single Source of Truth for Business Logic:</strong> The core logic resides within the domain
                    model, making the code easier to maintain and understand. When business rule changes are needed,
                    developers only need to modify methods inside the objects themselves, rather than refactoring
                    external `ValidationService` classes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Simplified Testing:</strong> Since validation rules are built into the objects, tests can
                    directly verify the correctness of the domain model's behavior. This ensures not only data structure
                    validation but also all business invariants, making the system more reliable.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Adherence to the "Make Illegal States Unrepresentable" Principle:</strong> By preventing the
                    creation of objects with invalid data, the need for additional validation checks in higher
                    application layers is minimized.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Anemic Domain Model with External Validation (ValidationService)</h3>
            <p>In this approach, domain model objects are merely data containers — they contain no business logic.
                Validation and enforcement of invariants are delegated to external services (e.g., `ValidationService`),
                which accept DTOs or models and verify their "correctness."</p>

            <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scattered Business Logic:</strong> All validation logic is concentrated in separate services
                    rather than being distributed across domain objects. This leads to validation rules and business
                    logic residing in different places, making the code harder to understand and maintain.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Additional Code and Risk of Desynchronization:</strong> When using an external
                    `ValidationService`, developers must ensure that validation is explicitly called before modifying an
                    aggregate's state. Any oversight can result in the object transitioning into an invalid state, as
                    the object itself is unaware of the need for validation.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Increased Coupling:</strong> Code relying on external validation must constantly interact
                    with `ValidationService`, complicating testing — especially when mocking complex business processes
                    is required.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>An Anemic Domain Model, where logic is separated and moved into external services, can lead to
                duplication, complex interactions, and inconsistencies between validations that reside outside the
                domain objects themselves.</p>

            <h3>Why is a Rich Domain Model Preferable?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Enforcement of Invariants:</strong> Domain objects are created and modified only
                    through methods that ensure all business rules are satisfied.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Consolidated Business Logic:</strong> All rules and validations reside within domain
                    objects, simplifying modifications and maintenance.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Increased System Reliability:</strong> Preventing the creation of "dirty" objects reduces
                    the risk of system corruption, even when business requirements change.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>By embedding validation and business rules directly into domain objects, the Rich Domain Model approach
                ensures stronger encapsulation, better maintainability, and fewer runtime integrity issues compared to
                an Anemic Domain Model with external validation.</p>

            <hr>
            <h1>ORM validation</h1>
            <p>ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools are used for interacting with databases, but they can also perform
                intermediate data validation before persistence. However, their role in validation often sparks debate.
                Let's explore how Doctrine and ActiveRecord (e.g., in Laravel) approach this issue.</p>

            <h3>Doctrine (Data Mapper): Validation via Symfony</h3>
            <p>Doctrine itself does not include validators but integrates closely with the Symfony Validator, enabling
                it to serve as a final validation layer before writing to the database.</p>

            <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Annotations/Attributes: Validation rules are added directly to entities.</li>
                <li>Syntactic Checks: Data formats, types, and uniqueness.</li>
                <li>Lifecycle Integration: Validations are executed before `flush()`.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example with Symfony Validator:</strong></p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints as Assert;

#[ORM\Entity]
class User {
    #[ORM\Id]
    #[ORM\GeneratedValue]
    #[ORM\Column]
    private int $id;
    
    #[ORM\Column]
    #[Assert\NotBlank]
    #[Assert\Email]
    private string $email;
    
    #[ORM\Column]
    #[Assert\Range(min: 1, max: 100)]
    private int $age;
}</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>ActiveRecord (Laravel Eloquent): Validation in Models</h3>
            <p>ActiveRecord models (e.g., Eloquent in Laravel) often combine validation with business logic, which
                contradicts clean architecture principles but is practical in use.</p>

            <p><strong>Example of Validation in Eloquent:</strong></p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>class User extends Model {
    protected static function boot() {
        parent::boot();

        static::saving(function ($user) {
            $validator = Validator::make($user->toArray(), [
                'email' => 'required|email',
                'age' => 'integer|min:1|max:100',
            ]);
            if ($validator->fails()) {
                throw new ValidationException($validator);
            }
        });
    }
}</pre>
            </div>

            <blockquote>SRP Violation: Model is responsible for both data and validation.</blockquote>

            <h3>Guarantee of data consistency</h3>
            <p><strong>Automatic Type Checking:</strong> ORM leverages the database schema to automatically validate
                types and value ranges, reducing the likelihood of passing incorrect data into the application.</p>

            <p><strong>Security:</strong> For example, checks for SQL injection, provided by ORM tools and database
                configurations, mitigate attack risks by filtering out invalid input values.</p>

            <h3>Audit mechanisms</h3>
            <p><strong>Error Tracking:</strong> ORM tools enable logging of persistence errors, simplifying debugging
                and monitoring compliance with business invariants at the persistence level.</p>

            <hr>
            <h1>Database</h1>
            <p>Working with the database serves as the final shield, protecting the application from errors and
                violations of business rules, even if earlier validation layers (DTOs, domain model, services) fail to
                catch them. Validation at the framework level, implemented through ORM tools and infrastructure, ensures
                reliable preservation of data integrity and acts as an additional protective mechanism. Let's explore
                the key aspects of this approach.</p>

            <h3>Data types</h3>
            <p>Each table column has a clearly defined data type (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE), which automatically filters
                out invalid values. Attempting to insert text into a numeric field will result in an error even before
                additional constraints are applied.</p>

            <h3>Constraints</h3>
            <p>The DBMS gives low-order boundaries, which will inevitably stagnate under the hour of any operations with
                data:</p>

            <p><strong>PRIMARY KEY</strong> — guarantees the uniqueness and presence of a NULL value in the key field.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>FOREIGN KEY</strong> — ensures connections between tables and records any changes to records that
                are sent.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>UNIQUE</strong> — guarantees the uniqueness of the value of the item (for example, for email).
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email UNIQUE (email);</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>NOT NULL</strong> — blocks NULL values from the column.</p>

            <p><strong>CHECK</strong> — checks the values behind a given mind.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (price > 0)
);</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Triggers</h3>
            <p>Triggers enable the implementation of complex validation logic that cannot be expressed with standard
                constraints. For example, validating the format of a phone number or the correctness of time
                intervals.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>CREATE TRIGGER validate_phone_format
BEFORE INSERT ON customers
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.phone NOT REGEXP '^[0-9]{10}$' THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Invalid phone format';
    END IF;
END;</pre>
            </div>

            <blockquote><strong>Important:</strong> It is not recommended to fully delegate domain validation related to business
                logic to the database level, particularly through DB constraints. This can lead to duplication of rules
                across different system layers and complicate their modification. For example, changing validation
                conditions (if hardcoded in a `CHECK` constraint or Triggers) would require altering the database
                schema, which often becomes a bottleneck in development. Additionally, error messages from the database
                are typically technical and lack the flexibility needed to inform users effectively. DB constraints
                should be used only for basic validations (e.g., age >= 0), while complex business rules (such as email
                validation via regular expressions) are better implemented at the application level, where they are
                easier to test and adapt.</blockquote>

            <hr>
            <h1>Safety</h1>
            <p>Among numerous threats, three key vulnerabilities remain critical even for modern systems: SQL
                injections, XSS, and CSRF. These exploit weaknesses in data validation, request handling, and session
                management, turning ordinary application functions into "loopholes" for attackers. SQL injections target
                databases by manipulating query logic, XSS injects malicious code through the client side, and CSRF
                tricks users into performing unwanted actions without their knowledge. Understanding the mechanisms of
                these attacks and how to neutralize them is not just theoretical knowledge but an essential skill for
                developers. In the following sections, we will explore how these vulnerabilities work, their
                consequences, and how to build robust defenses at the backend level.</p>

            <h3>SQL Injection</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> An attacker injects malicious SQL code through input fields (e.g., form
                inputs) to gain unauthorized access to or manipulate a database.</p>

            <p><strong>Common Backend Errors:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using raw SQL queries with string concatenation.</li>
                <li>Failing to escape or parameterize user inputs.</li>
                <li>Missing data type validation (e.g., expecting a number but receiving a string).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Vulnerable Code Example (PHP)</strong></p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>
echo "<dіv>" . $_POST['comment'] . "</dіv>";
// If comment contains: <scrіpt>alert('XSS')</scrіpt> → Executes!
</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>How to Mitigate:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)</li>
                <li>ORM Libraries: Tools like Doctrine (PHP) auto-escape inputs.</li>
                <li>Input Validation and Type Casting</li>
                <li>Minimize Database Privileges: The application's database account should not have permissions for
                    destructive operations like DROP TABLE.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Injection of malicious JavaScript code through data rendered on a webpage
                (e.g., comments, user profiles). The attack executes in the victim's browser.</p>

            <p><strong>Common Backend Errors:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Outputting user-supplied data without escaping.</li>
                <li>Allowing raw HTML/JS in user-generated content (e.g., via WYSIWYG editors) without sanitization.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Vulnerable Code Example (PHP)</strong></p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>
    echo "<div>" . $_POST['comment'] . "</div>";
// If comment contains: alert('XSS') → Executes!
</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>How to Mitigate:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Escape Output: Use functions like htmlspecialchars() (PHP) or framework utilities.</li>
                <li>Content Security Policy (CSP): Restrict inline scripts via HTTP headers.</li>
                <li>Sanitize HTML Input: Use libraries like HTMLPurifier (PHP) or DOMPurify (JS) for WYSIWYG content.
                </li>
                <li>Use Modern Frameworks: React/Vue/Angular auto-escape by default (but stay cautious with
                    dangerouslySetInnerHTML or v-html).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> An attacker tricks a user into unknowingly executing malicious actions on a
                website where they're authenticated (e.g., transferring money, changing passwords).</p>

            <p><strong>Common Backend Errors:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>No CSRF tokens implemented.</li>
                <li>Relying solely on cookies for authentication (which browsers send automatically).</li>
                <li>Using GET requests for state-changing actions (GET should be idempotent).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Vulnerable Code Example (PHP)</strong></p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>// Backend processes a money transfer without CSRF token validation
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $amount = (float) $_POST['amount'];
    // ... execute transfer ...
}</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>How to Mitigate:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generate a unique token per user session</li>
                <li>Embed it in forms and validate it on submission.</li>
                <li>SameSite Cookies: Set cookies with SameSite=Strict or Lax to prevent cross-origin requests.</li>
                <li>Require Re-Authentication: For sensitive actions (e.g., payments), prompt for passwords/2FA.</li>
                <li>Avoid GET for State Changes: Use POST/PUT/DELETE for actions that modify data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Architectural approaches for validation</h1>
            <p>Data validation is not just a set of checks — it's a sophisticated process requiring thoughtful
                architecture. Modern applications need to validate data at multiple levels, from syntax to business
                context. How can we organize this process to keep the code maintainable and the rules flexible? Let's
                examine three key approaches.</p>

            <h3>Middleware: Input Validation</h3>
            <p>Middleware acts as a "checkpoint" for incoming requests. It intercepts data before it reaches business
                logic and performs preliminary validation. You can add middleware layers to verify authentication, CSRF
                tokens, JSON formatting, or request structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Centralization: Common rules (e.g., header checks) apply automatically to all routes.</li>
                <li>Flexibility: Specific endpoints or groups (e.g., API vs. admin panel) can enforce custom rules
                    (e.g., token requirements or role-based access).
                </li>
                <li>Performance: Requests with obvious errors (e.g., malformed Content-Type) are rejected early, saving
                    server resources.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Validation Services: Reusable Business Logic</h3>
            <p>When validations become complex (e.g., checking the uniqueness of a combination of fields or integrating
                with third-party APIs), they are moved to separate services. This allows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Code isolation: Validation logic is not scattered across controllers but resides in dedicated
                    classes like `UserRegistrationValidator`.
                </li>
                <li>Simplified testing: Services can be tested independently of the HTTP layer, with dependencies
                    (databases, external APIs) mocked.
                </li>
                <li>Logic reuse: The same validator can be used for APIs, CLI commands, and CSV data imports.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chain of Responsibility: Validation in a Chain</h3>
            <p>The Chain of Responsibility pattern breaks down complex validations into sequential stages. Each handler
                in the chain is responsible for its own part:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax: The first handler checks basic parameters, such as data types and required fields.</li>
                <li>Business Rules: Subsequent stages analyze data in the context of the domain (e.g., whether there are
                    sufficient funds in an account for a transfer).
                </li>
                <li>External Checks: Final handlers may query external services (e.g., CAPTCHA verification or
                    anti-fraud systems).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scalability: New validations can be added without rewriting existing code — simply create a new
                    handler.
                </li>
                <li>Clarity: Each class focuses on a single responsibility, aligning with the SOLID principles.</li>
                <li>Dynamic Configuration: Different chains can be assembled for various scenarios (e.g., strict
                    validation for payments and simplified validation for reviews).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Strategy Pattern: Dynamic Validation Selection</h3>
            <p>The Strategy pattern enables the selection of a validation algorithm on the fly, depending on the
                context. For example, data validation may vary for different user types, regions, or use cases.</p>

            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flexibility: Rules can be changed without modifying the core code.</li>
                <li>Elimination of Conditionals: Instead of using if-else statements, you leverage polymorphism.</li>
                <li>Easy Testing: Each strategy can be tested in isolation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Choose an Approach?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Middleware is ideal for cross-cutting validations (e.g., authentication, CORS).</li>
                <li>Services are suitable for complex validations involving external calls.</li>
                <li>Chain of Responsibility is best for sequential validations.</li>
                <li>Strategy is appropriate when dynamically switching between validation algorithms is required.</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote><strong>Important:</strong> These approaches do not exclude but complement each other. For example,
                Middleware can validate headers, Chain of Responsibility can handle request data, and a Service can
                manage business logic validation.</blockquote>

            <h1>Data Validation in Microservice Architecture</h1>
            <p>Microservice architecture, despite its flexibility and scalability, complicates data validation
                management due to the distributed nature of services. Each microservice handles its own domain,
                necessitating careful design of data validation at every stage of interaction. Let's explore the key
                aspects of validation in such an architecture.</p>

            <h3>Local Validation in Microservices</h3>
            <p>Each microservice must independently validate data related to its domain. This includes checking formats,
                data types, and business rules specific to that service. This approach ensures encapsulation of logic
                and reduces dependency on other services.</p>

            <h3>Validation of Data Between Microservices</h3>
            <p>When one microservice relies on data from another (e.g., an order service requiring user information from
                a user service), inter-service validation becomes necessary. Several approaches address this
                challenge:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Synchronous Requests:</strong> Upon receiving data, a microservice makes an HTTP request to
                    another service to verify its validity. This method is straightforward to implement but can increase
                    latency and reduce fault tolerance due to dependency on the availability of other services.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Asynchronous Messaging and Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> Using message brokers (e.g.,
                    RabbitMQ) allows microservices to exchange events and data asynchronously. This improves scalability
                    and reduces coupling between services but complicates error handling and requires careful design.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Replication:</strong> Some data from one microservice can be copied and periodically
                    updated in another for local validation. This reduces inter-service calls but may lead to data
                    staleness and additional synchronization complexities.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Centralized Schemas and Contracts</h3>
            <p>To ensure data consistency across microservices, centralized schemas and API contracts are
                recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>API Contracts:</strong> Defining clear contracts between services ensures that transmitted
                    data conforms to expected formats and structures. Tools like OpenAPI can be useful for documenting
                    and maintaining these contracts.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Schemas:</strong> Using shared data schemas (e.g., JSON Schema) enables standardized
                    validation and structure for data exchanged between services.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Effective data validation in a microservice architecture requires balancing local service
                responsibilities with the need for inter-service interaction, while considering performance, security,
                and data consistency.</p>
