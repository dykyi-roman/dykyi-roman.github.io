            <h2>🔔 Introduction</h2>
            <p>In software development, there are often situations where it's necessary to provide external access to a
                local server. This can be useful for various reasons: testing webhooks from external services,
                conducting client demonstrations, or collaborating with remote teams. Imagine you've developed an
                amazing web application, but it's only accessible on your local machine. How can you showcase it to
                friends, colleagues, or potential investors? In such cases, tunneling becomes a great solution.
                Tunneling services allow you to create a temporary public URL that redirects incoming traffic to the
                developer's local server. This enables you to test the application's functionality in an environment
                close to real-world conditions, without the need to deploy it on full-scale hosting or servers.</p>

            <h3>What is a local server tunnel?</h3>
            <p>A tunnel for a local server is a technology that connects a local host (e.g., http://localhost:8000) to a
                public URL accessible via the internet. The tunnel acts as an intermediary, redirecting all requests
                from the public address to your local server. This makes it a convenient tool for the following
                tasks:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Working with APIs:</strong> Easily test and debug integrations with external services that
                    send requests to your server.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Testing webhooks:</strong> Many external APIs, such as payment gateways, notification
                    systems, or messaging platforms, send event notifications via webhooks. With tunneling, you can
                    quickly set up and debug these interactions without hosting the server publicly.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Real-time demonstrations:</strong> Present your projects and new features without deploying
                    them to external hosting.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Remote collaboration:</strong> Share intermediate development results with colleagues and
                    clients effortlessly.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How does tunneling work?</h3>
            <p>Tunneling is based on a simple yet effective mechanism. A tunneling service runs on your computer and
                creates a tunnel between your local server and the external world. When someone accesses the public
                link, the request is routed through the tunnel and instantly directed to your local server. This
                approach provides convenient access to your resources, enabling you to showcase and test web
                applications in their current state.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>🔖 Use Cases</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Login:</strong> Integrating with social platforms (e.g., OAuth for
                        Facebook, Google, or Twitter) often requires your server to be publicly accessible to handle
                        responses after successful authorization.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Gateways:</strong> Payment systems like Stripe, PayPal, or LiqPay send
                        transaction status notifications via webhooks. A tunnel allows you to quickly debug these
                        notifications and ensure the data is processed correctly.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Webhook Integrations:</strong> External services like GitHub, Slack, or Zapier use
                        webhooks to notify about events (e.g., a new commit, channel message, or automation trigger). A
                        tunnel enables you to receive these notifications in real time.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> Debugging push notifications for mobile or web applications
                        requires your server to accept and process external requests.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Access to Third-Party APIs:</strong> Some APIs require verifying your server's
                        availability (e.g., when sending data to a specified URL). Tunneling helps create public access
                        for such verifications.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Online Demonstrations:</strong> If you're showcasing a prototype or MVP to potential
                        clients, colleagues, or investors, a tunnel allows you to quickly deploy the current application
                        version for presentation purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Testing External Integrations:</strong> Working with external services that require your
                        server to be accessible (e.g., email services or analytics systems) becomes easier with
                        tunneling.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Messenger Bot Development:</strong> When developing bots for Telegram, WhatsApp, or
                        Facebook Messenger, you need to configure webhooks to receive messages. Tunneling allows you to
                        quickly set up and test bot-server interactions.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Debugging Notification Systems:</strong> Integrating with notification systems that
                        require callback verification (e.g., SMS or delivery status notifications) involves testing with
                        real requests, which can be facilitated through tunneling.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    access and security requirements.</p>

                <p>For users who prefer using SSH, Serveo is a good option. It is convenient because it doesn't require
                    additional software installation. You simply use the standard SSH client to create the tunnel,
                    making it a simple and effective solution for developers familiar with the command line and looking
                    to minimize additional dependencies.</p>
            </section>

            <p>Now, let’s dive deeper into Ngrok and see how it works in practice.</p>

            <section>
                <hr>
                <h1>Ngrok</h1>
                <p>Ngrok is a tool for developers that allows you to create secure tunnels from your local computer to
                    the public internet. This is especially useful when you need to provide access to a local web server
                    (for example, for testing webhooks, demos, or development) without deploying it on a real
                    server.</p>

                <h3>Installation</h3>
                <p>Ngrok can be downloaded from the official website https://ngrok.com. The free version allows you to
                    create one tunnel, while the paid version provides additional features such as persistent subdomains
                    and higher performance.</p>

                <h4>Installation on macOS:</h4>
                <p>If you’re using macOS, you can install Ngrok with Homebrew (a package manager for macOS).</p>

                <p>2. Run the following command to install Ngrok:</p>
                <code>brew install ngrok</code>
                <p>3. Once installed, you can verify Ngrok installation by running:</p>
                <code>ngrok version</code>

                <h4>Installation on Linux:</h4>
                <p>1. Open a terminal.</p>
                <p>2. Download the latest Ngrok release:</p>
                <code>wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip</code>
                <p>3. Unzip the downloaded file:</p>
                <code>unzip ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip</code>
                <p>4. Move the ngrok binary to a directory in your PATH (e.g., /usr/local/bin):</p>
                <code>sudo mv ngrok /usr/local/bin</code>
                <p>5. Verify Ngrok installation:</p>
                <code>ngrok version</code>

                <h4>Installation on Windows:</h4>
                <p>1. Go to the Ngrok website and download the Windows version of Ngrok.</p>
                <p>2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file.</p>
                <p>3. Move the ngrok.exe file to a folder of your choice (e.g., C:\ngrok).</p>
                <p>4. Add the directory to your system’s PATH environment variable:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Right-click This PC (or Computer) > Properties.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Click Advanced system settings > Environment Variables.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Under System variables, find and select the Path variable, then click Edit.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Add the path to the Ngrok folder (e.g., C:\ngrok) and click OK.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>5. Open a new Command Prompt window and verify the installation:</p>
                <code>ngrok version</code>

                <h3>Authentication</h3>
                <p>Authenticating Ngrok with your account is optional but recommended after installation to unlock more
                    features and avoid hitting usage limits.</p>

                <p>1. Sign up or log in to your Ngrok account at https://dashboard.ngrok.com.</p>
                <p>2. Copy your authtoken from the dashboard.</p>
                <p>3. Run the command:</p>
                <div class="code"><pre>ngrok authtoken [your_authtoken]</pre></div>
                <p>Now you're ready to use Ngrok to create secure tunnels to your local server!</p>

                <h3>Main features</h3>
                <p>1. Creating tunnels: Ngrok allows you to create a tunnel to a local server, which is accessible via a
                    temporary public link (e.g., <code>https://random-string.ngrok.io</code>). By running Ngrok, you can share the
                    URL with others so they can access your local server.</p>

                <p>2. Webhook support: Ngrok is often used for testing webhooks, as many APIs require a public URL to
                    send data (e.g., payment systems, notification services, and others).</p>

                <p>Security: Ngrok encrypts the connection via HTTPS and provides authentication options, enhancing
                    security.</p>

                <p>Request logging: Ngrok logs the requests and responses passing through the tunnel, which is useful
                    for debugging and monitoring.</p>

                <h3>Example of use</h3>
                <p>1. Start a local server (for example, on `http://localhost:8000`).</p>
                <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
version: '3.8'

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      - ./src:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - app_network

  php:
    image: php:8.3-fpm
    volumes:
      - ./src:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - app_network

networks:
  app_network:
    driver: bridge
        </pre>
                </div>

                <p>2. In the command line, run the command:</p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre>ngrok http 8000</pre>
                </div>

                <p>In the result, you will see:</p>
                <img src="img/4.1.png" alt="" class="article-featured-img">

                <p>Ngrok will provide a public URL (<a href="https://41d8-128-199-48-62.ngrok-free.app">https://41d8-128-199-48-62.ngrok-free.app</a>), which will now direct
                    traffic to your local server, and a local URL (<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4040">http://127.0.0.1:4040</a>), which will now display the
                    server’s responses.</p>
                <img src="img/4.2.png" alt="" class="article-featured-img">

                <p>4. To interact with an external API, we need to create two routes:</p>
                <p><strong>api/test</strong> — this route will receive data from the client and send a request to the external
                    server.</p>
                <p><strong>api/webhook</strong> — this route will receive the response from the external API when it returns data after
                    processing.</p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre>
namespace App\Presentation\Api\Action;

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\JsonResponse;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

final class ApiTestAction
{
    #[Route('/api/test', name: 'api_test', methods: ['GET'])]
    public function __invoke(Request $request)
    {
        $callbackUrl = $request->query->get('callback_url');

        if ($callbackUrl) {
            $this->sendRequestToExternalApi($callbackUrl);
            return new JsonResponse(['status' => 'success', 'message' => 'Request sent successfully.']);
        }

        return new JsonResponse(['status' => 'error', 'message' => 'callback_url is required.'], 400);
    }

    private function sendRequestToExternalApi($callbackUrl)
    {
        // Logic for sending the request to the external API
    }
}

namespace App\Presentation\Api\Action;

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\JsonResponse;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

final class ApiWebhookAction
{
    #[Route('/api/webhook', name: 'api_webhook', methods: ['POST'])]
    public function __invoke(Request $request)
    {
        $data = json_decode($request->getContent(), true);
        return new JsonResponse(['status' => 'success', 'message' => 'Data received.']);
    }
}
                    </pre>
                </div>

                <p>5. Example request using curl</p>
                <p>To test the <code>api/test</code> route, we can send a request using curl. For example, if you want to pass a
                    callback_url that points to your local server via Ngrok:</p>

                <h3>Domains</h3>
                <p>Domain objects enable you to create Endpoints to listen for traffic on those domain names. Domains
                    may be a subdomain of an ngrok-managed base domain like foo.ngrok.app or you can bring your own
                    branded domain like foo.example.com. Read more detailed you can here.</p>

                <p>You can start from a free plan and receive a public URL: <a href="https://wildly-pro-guinea.ngrok-free.app">https://wildly-pro-guinea.ngrok-free.app</a>.</p>

                <h3>HTTPS</h3>
                <p>If HTTP alone isn’t sufficient for your needs, use the following command to set up a redirect to
                    HTTPS.</p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre>ngrok http --url=wildly-pro-guinea.ngrok-free.app {YOUR_PORT_NUMBER}</pre>
                </div>

                <h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Tunneling services are a great way to temporarily provide access to a local server without worrying
                    about complex network configuration. Whether you want to test webhooks, share your application with
                    your team, or showcase a prototype to clients, there are many tools that simplify this task. Try out
                    a few options and choose the one that best suits your project.</p>
