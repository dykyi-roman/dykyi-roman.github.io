            🔔 Introduction
            <h2>Team Lead and Tech Lead: Key Functional Roles</h2>
            <p>Team Lead and Tech Lead are NOT positions, but key functional roles in a team that experienced
                professionals can assume.</p>

            <p>A Team Lead is responsible for organizing the team’s work, maintaining a productive environment, and
                assisting colleagues in achieving common goals. In contrast, the Tech Lead focuses on the technical
                direction, making architectural decisions, and ensuring the project’s quality.</p>

            <p>In smaller companies, it’s common to merge both roles under the title of Team Lead. This combined role
                allows smaller teams to function with greater flexibility and efficiency, facilitating faster
                decision-making and closer alignment between technical objectives and team processes.</p>

            <p>These roles require not only professional skills but also the ability to guide, inspire, and support the
                team. In this article, I will share the essential skills, tools, and challenges faced by Team and Tech
                Leads, as well as discuss how to tackle difficulties and succeed in these roles.</p>

            <hr>
            <h1>🔬 Skills</h1>
            <p>After analyzing dozens of job postings, I have identified the key skills necessary for our roles.</p>

                management, or changing requirements, it’s important to remain flexible and ready to adapt to new
                conditions. Continuous learning, sharing experiences with colleagues, and actively participating in the
                professional community will not only help you overcome difficulties but also make you a more competent
                and confident leader.</p>

            <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scalability: As the project grows, it’s crucial to ensure its ability to handle increased loads and
                    data.
                </li>
                <li>Performance: To manage large volumes of data, you need to be able to profile code, optimize database
                    queries, and utilize caching.

            </ul>

            <hr>
            <h1>🎭 Tech/Team Lead — next step of a Senior career?</h1>
            <p>Many developers feel comfortable reaching the Senior level, myself included. This is quite
                understandable: deep technical knowledge, independence in decision-making, and a stable income — all of
                these are attractive. However, for those seeking something new, the role of Tech/Team Lead opens up new
                horizons.</p>

            <h3>Why should a Senior Developer consider transitioning to a Tech/Team Lead position?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Expanded Responsibilities: Instead of deep diving into code, you gain the opportunity to influence
                    the strategic development of the product and the team.
                </li>
                <li>Development of Soft Skills: Project management, team motivation, and task delegation all require the
                    development of communication and leadership qualities.
                </li>
                <li>A New Level of Professional Growth: The chance to grow not only as a technical specialist but also
                    as a leader.
                </li>
                <li>Higher Salary: Generally, Tech/Team Leads receive higher compensation for their knowledge and
                    experience.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, the transition to a Tech/Team Lead position comes with new challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Less Time for Coding: Much of your time will be spent on planning, communication, and resolving
                    organizational issues.
                </li>
                <li>Responsibility for Team Results: The success of the entire project will depend on your decisions.
                </li>
                <li>Conflict Management: Not all team members will always agree with your decisions, and you will need
                    to know how to resolve conflicts.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Questions to Ask Yourself Before Making a Decision:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Am I ready to delegate tasks and trust others?</li>
                <li>How well do I communicate and motivate people?</li>
                <li>Am I prepared to take responsibility for the team’s results?</li>
                <li>Do I want to develop in the direction of project management?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you answered these questions positively, then you can confidently move forward and build a career as a
                Tech/Team Lead!</p>
