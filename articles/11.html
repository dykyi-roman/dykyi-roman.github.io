                                                Before diving into this article, please note that all examples and
                                                explanations are based on interpreting MVC with a Passive Model, where
                                                “M” (Model) represents a data provider — not the business logic layer.
                                                This approach is chosen to demonstrate core principles but doesn’t
                                                exclude other implementations.</p>

                                                    layer. It’s the core hub of all business logic. Models encapsulate
                                                    not only data but also behavior, and may include other models —

                                                (Model–View–Controller)</a> is an architectural pattern proposed by
                                                Trygve Reenskaug in the late 1970s, which divides code into three parts:
                                                the model (data and business logic), the view (UI), and the controller
                                                (request handler). Due to its simplicity and clarity, MVC (or MVP in web
                                                development) has become the de facto standard in web development: it
                                                simplifies understanding the application and distributes responsibility
                                                for different types of work. However, its simplicity is deceptive: as a
                                                project grows, even such a pattern creates “technical debt.”</p>

                                                but as the system grows, its layers begin to blur. As the system

                                                requires session synchronization, shared file systems, and other
                                                workarounds. Microservices become impossible because everything is

                                                for both data and some business rules, tightly coupling them with
                                                persistence details (database operations). Meanwhile, as mentioned

                                                becomes impossible due to tight coupling of models with ActiveRecord.
                                                The Factory pattern degenerates into static methods inside models,
                                                violating OOP principles.</p>

                                                not an implementation of the classic Facade design pattern. As a result,
